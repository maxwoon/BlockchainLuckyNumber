Blockchain Lucky Number - decentralized lottery with transparent charity donation

Demo of an imperfect but transparent lottery / raffle running on blockchain with auto-donation to specified charity, and optional player initiated partial donation of their winnings to the charity.

Run your own transparent charity drive on blockchain with your own copy / derivative of this smart contract.

Open to collaboration to improve this until the day corporate / state / national / global lotteries, raffles and sweepstakes run on blockchains with full transparency.
